              Carrying Kawasaki riders to six World Superbike titles, the Ninja
              ZX-10R has demonstrated its championship-winning performance while
              allowing a wide range of riders to experience the thrill of
              exploring their limits on the circuit. To ensure its continued
              competitiveness, a host of changes to engine and chassis build on
              this proven performance; next-generation Ninja styling offers
              significantly improved aerodynamics; and new features like
              Electronic Cruise Control and a TFT instrument panel with
              smartphone connectivity enhance street-riding enjoyment.

              The Kawasaki Ninja ZX-10R is a high-performance sportbike that has
              gained immense popularity among motorcycle enthusiasts worldwide.
              Renowned for its track-focused design and exceptional power, the
              Ninja ZX-10R delivers an exhilarating riding experience. The Ninja
              ZX-10R was first introduced in India and has since become one of
              the most sought-after superbikes in its class. It is equipped with
              a 998 cc, inline-four engine that generates impressive power and
              torque, providing blistering acceleration and thrilling top
              speeds. The engine is mated to a 6-speed gearbox with a slipper
              clutch for smooth gear shifts and enhanced control during
              aggressive downshifts. Whether you're carving through corners on
              the track or enjoying spirited rides on the open road, the
              Kawasaki Ninja ZX-10R delivers thrilling performance, precise
              handling, and unmatched adrenaline.

              It all begins with the way this motorcycle looks, most notably the
              new face. Kawasaki sparked online debates about the Kawasaki Ninja
              H2-inspired front end, on whether it was nothing but an ugly
              cut-paste job on the 2021 ZX-10R. I had my reservations as well,
              however, in the real world, this Ninja looks bold and aggressive.
              I’d go to the extent of saying that it looks characterful.
            </p>

              The large air intake duct in the centre is flanked by recessed LED
              headlights that give it a menacing face. The effect is also a
              result of the prominent chin spoilers below the headlights as well
              as the cleverly integrated ducts next to them. These ducts channel
              air into them and out through vents on the top of the side
              fairing. This helps improve high-speed downforce by 17 percent,
              although, the road is no place to test that. Nevertheless, I like
              how aesthetically clean and simple this aerodynamics business is
              on the Ninja, instead of the rather ugly winglets seen on some
              superbikes of its ilk.

              There are very few moments in life that remain firmly etched in
              one’s memory. Like, for instance, being perched on a 200hp+,
              litre-class superbike and watching the world whizz by in a blur.
              The sound of the intake howl reverberating in the ear as your
              brain struggles to keep up with the rapidly changing numbers on
              the speedo, is a rush unlike anything else. Especially on
              something as potent, yet accessible as the new Kawasaki Ninja
              ZX-10R.
            </p>
            <p>
              Armed with a comprehensive set of updates for 2021, Kawasaki
              claims to have enhanced what is already an incredibly fast
              machine. Now, if wishes were horses, I’d be flying down the back
              straight of the BIC, rather than feeling caged on the public road
              system. Still, you’d have to be utterly mad to pass the
              opportunity of riding a superbike, even if it’s on the road. And
              as I discovered, this format of motorcycling has an irresistible
              draw.
            </p>
            <p>
              It’s on a tight twisty road that the Ninja’s chassis setup really
              comes to the fore and you realise why this superbike is looked
              upon with such reverence. Kawasaki has made a few tweaks this time
              by fitting an 8mm longer swingarm and lowering its pivot point by
              1mm. The lowered triple clamp has also led to greater front fork
              offset, further contributing to the longer wheelbase. The result
              is a motorcycle that’s super stable at corner entry, mid corner
              and while exiting. Turn in felt quick for a 207kg motorcycle and
              even direction changes don’t require a lot of effort.
