              The All-New Classic 350 continues to embody the traditions and
              craftsmanship of the past as it is reborn. Inspired by the post
              war G2 model, first born in 1950’s, the all new Classic 350
              continues to be a testament to the timeless design which took the
              motorcycling world with an awe back in the heydays of British
              motorcycling. The Classic teardrop fuel tank, the distinctive
              thump and the hallmark casquette headlamp - all harmonise as one,
              rejoicing in the masterpiece that is the timeless Royal Enfield
              Classic.

              The 2021 model looks similar to the old motorcycle and it
              continues to pack styling features such as a round headlight, a
              round shape for the rear-view mirrors, a curvy fuel tank, a
              split-style saddle, and a side-slung exhaust. The list of changes
              includes the addition of a semi-digital instrument cluster and a
              USB charging port. The updated cluster includes an analogue
              speedometer along with an LCD screen that shows an odometer, trip
              meters, clock, and fuel gauge. The updated switchgear includes
              Meteor 350-style rotary buttons. The 2021 model also gets the
              Royal Enfield Tripper navigation system although that is currently
              available on the Chrome variants only.
            </p>

              The mechanical specifications include a 349cc, air/oil-cooled
              engine that is based on the company’s J-platform. Linked to a
              five-speed gearbox, the engine is tuned to deliver 20.2bhp of
              power and 27Nm of peak torque.
            </p>
            <p>
              The updated hardware on the 2021 model includes a new dual cradle
              frame. The suspension tasks are handled by 41mm telescopic forks
              at the front and preload-adjustable twin shock absorbers at the
              back. The braking duties are performed by single discs on both
              wheels. The Redditch variants, however, come with a front
              disc/rear drum setup. The dual disc models use dual-channel ABS
              while the Redditch range uses a single-channel ABS.
